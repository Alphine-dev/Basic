# Basic
Basic is a tool for new web developer who just started web developing, when I started web development i often get scaired and thought of quitting because how hard it was to set and configure a project from scratch without knowing any thing. I made this tool by using other portable open-source tools which was avelable to me

**To get started run this command in the terminal**

    npx degit Project-Alphine/basic-vanilla your-project-name
- this should install a folder with a given name
- cd into the folder and then run
> npm install
- this will install all the necessory dependencies in the folder.
- then run
>npm run dev

this will start the development server on **port** 3000.
