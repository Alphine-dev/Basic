# Basic
Basic is a tool for new web developers who just started web development, when I started web development I often get scared and thought of quitting because of how hard it was to setup and configure a project from scratch without knowing anything. I made this tool by using other portable open-source tools which were available to me

**To get started run this command in the terminal**

    npx degit Project-Alphine/basic-vanilla your-project-name

- this should install a folder with a given name
- cd into the folder and then run
> npm install
- this will install all the necessary dependencies in the folder.
- then run
>npm run dev

this will start the development server on **port** 3000.

> **Now to compile from SCSS to CSS run this command.**

    npm run compile
this is check for changes and will update your css.
